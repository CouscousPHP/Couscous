Couscous generates a [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) website from your markdown documentation.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CouscousPHP/Couscous.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CouscousPHP/Couscous)

Read more about Couscous and its documentation on [the website](http://couscousphp.github.io/Couscous/). This README is targeted at developers.

## Why?

Couscous is different from [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) or [Phrozn](http://phrozn.info/). They are generic static websites generator, at best targeted for blogs, and using them to put documentation online is clunky.

Couscous lets you get started with *no requirements* and a single command. And deploy without prior configuration with one command too.

So if you want to put a blog online, use Sculpin! If you want documentation, use Couscous!

## Usage

Everything is documented on [the website](http://couscousphp.github.io/Couscous/).

## How Couscous works?

Couscous was designed to be as simple as possible. By embracing simplicity, it becomes extremely simple to extend.

### Website generation

The website generation is composed of a list of **steps** to process the `Repository` model object:

```php
interface StepInterface
{
    /**
     * Process the given repository.
     *
     * @param Repository      $repository
     * @param OutputInterface $output     Output for the user.
     */
    public function __invoke(Repository $repository, OutputInterface $output);
}
```

Steps are very granular, thus extremely easy to write and test. For example:

- `LoadConfig`: loads the `couscous.yml` config file
- `RunBowerInstall`
- `LoadMarkdownFiles`: load the content of all the `*.md` files in memory
- `RenderMarkdown`: render the markdown content
- `WriteFiles`: write the in-memory processed files to the target directory
- â€¦

For example, here is a step that would preprocess Markdown files to put the word "Couscous" in bold:

```php
class PutCouscousInBold implements StepInterface
{
    public function __invoke(Repository $repository, OutputInterface $output)
    {
        /** @var MarkdownFile[] $markdownFiles */
        $markdownFiles = $repository->findFilesByType('Couscous\Model\MarkdownFile');

        foreach ($markdownFiles as $file) {
            $file->content = str_replace('Couscous', '**Couscous**', $file->content);
        }
    }
}
```

Couscous uses [PHP-DI](http://php-di.org/) for wiring everything together with dependency injection.

### Website deployment

Couscous deploys by cloning (in a temp directory) the current repository, checking out the `gh-pages` branch, generating the website inside it, committing and pushing.

In the future, Couscous will support several deployment strategies.
